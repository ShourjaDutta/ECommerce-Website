# ECommerce-Website

Welcome to 'Shophub' - my E-Commerce Website! This repository contains a website for an e-commerce website.

This project implements fullstack development to create a website that resembles any arbitrary e-commerce website in the Internet. It includes both user and admin panels. I have used HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL to develop this project.

To visit the website:
1. Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Search "https://localhost/[Path of home.php inside htdocs folder of xampp main folder]" to access user panel.
3. Search "https://localhost/[Path of admin_login.php inside htdocs folder of xampp main folder]" to access admin panel.
4. Search shop_db at "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/" to access database.
